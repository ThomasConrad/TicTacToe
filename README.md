# TicTacToe
 Exam project creating a CPU player in TicTacToe. 

 This is meant to be run on an arduino mega. The pin layout is not saved but is implied in the code. It ran a TicTacToe game on a 16x2 character lcd with physical playing pieces. Magnets are inserted in the pieces and hall sensors are used to find the board layout. A CPU player is programmed so it is a playver vs CPU game. There is also code for printing the hall sensor readings and controlling stepper motors.
